# Declaring Classes

In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later.

3. The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. **A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.**

3. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. **A class can implement more than one interface.**
