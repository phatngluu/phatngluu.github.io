+++
See details [here](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module)

In this tutorial you'll create two modules: 
- The first is a library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or applications. 
- The second is a caller application which will use the first.

This tutorial's sequence includes six brief topics that each illustrate a different part of the language.

1. Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
2. Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module.
3. Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling.
4. Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
5. Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map.
6. Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
7. Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally.
