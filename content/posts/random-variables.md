# Random variables - RV

Random variables are ways to **map** **outcomes** of random processes to **numbers**.

For examples:

1. Flipping a coin: X = {0 if head, 1 if tail}
2. Sum of upward face after rolling 7 dice

## Discrete and continous RV

Discrete: distinct/separate value:

* X = {0 heads, 1 tails}
* X = Year that a random student was born
* X = # of ants born tomorrow
* X = Execution time of a program every time it get executed (rounded to the nearest miliseconds).

Continous: any value in interval:

* Y = Exact mass of a random animal in a zoo
* Y = Exact execution time of a program every time it get executed.

Discrete: take on only **certain values**; Continous: take on **any value at any point** along an interval.

## Constructing a probability distribution for random variable

The probability distribution of the random variable X is a **description** of the **probabilities** with the **possible numerical values of X**.

A probability distribution of a discrete random variable can be:

1\. A **list** of the **possible values** **along** with their **probabilities**.

2\. A **formula** that is used to **calculate** the **probability** in **response** to an input of the **random variableâ€™s value**.
